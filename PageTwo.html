    <h1> + From Sketchbooks to Digital Devices + </h1>
    <p> Like every artists, I owned mountains and mountains of sketchbooks. </p>

</p> Drawings filled mainly from anime and video games popularized of the time. </p>
</p> Looking back, the drawing were cringe-y and got rid of them. I wish I haven't. They would've been a good example of how much I changed as an artist. </p>
</p> Up until 2012, I obtained an iPad 2nd Gen tablet from Mom!</p>

</p> Still functions and continue to draw with it to this day!</p>
