    <h1> + The Rise of A.I + </h1>
    <p> When I found out that AI is here to stay, understood the assignment, and was now a new era of art, </p>
 </p> I was very concerned. Making art but making a a prompt sounded lazy but work smarter not harder I guess? </p>
</p>Doesn't help when certain A.I images...</p>

 </p>LOOK </p>

 </p>LIKE </p>

 </p>THIS? </p>
<img src="Mistake3.jpg" alt="image3">

</p> This is what's suppose to replace hard-working artists? Okay. </p> I can laugh at it now but A.I and ChatGPT have advancing and more. Companies I wanted to work for are using it. </p>
</p> Artist I looked up to are using it. Others have encouraged to use other AI type of programs like ChatGPT. </p>


</p> I used it a couple of time to make lists of other artists to check out but I don't want to use it regardless. I want to avoid it as much as I can. It looks like becoming an artist</p>

</p> is becoming harder than it already is.</p>
